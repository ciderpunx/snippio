<h2>About Snipp.IO
<p>This is a pastebin application made out of <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com">Yesod</a> and <a href="http://http://www.mongodb.org/">mongodb</a>, by <a href="http://charlieharvey.org.uk/">Charlie Harvey</a>. Yes, it does sound a bit fucking hipster. What can I say? At least it&#8217;s not ruby.

<p>The idea is that you can log in with your openid (or Google or Yahoo! account if you must) and paste stuff straight to the web. 
<h2>From the commandline 
<p>It is entirely possible to use Snipp.IO from the commandline, which is my primary use case. Perhaps it will be useful for you as well. 
<p>To POST your snippets from the commandline, you&#8217;ll need an API key. Log in and it&#8217;s at the bottom of each page, in the footer. 
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of using Snipp.IO from the commandline with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>. 
<p>^{cliUsage}
<p>This will return an URL that you can visit in your browser. 
<h2>Caveat emptor
<p>I&#8217;d love to have unlimited storage, but I don&#8217;t. I have a free 512MB sandbox account courtesy of <a href="https://www.mongohq.com/home">MongoHQ</a> (thanks!). So stuff may vanish.
